# AV-Updates

## Description
This script is designed to download the latest definitions for various Anti-Virus software. The script will download the latest definitions for the AV software that is installed on the system to the new folder from where the script was made into a folder for today's date `.\AV-Updates\YYYY-MM-DD`. The script will also create a hash log file in the same directory as the script so you have an MD5 and SHA256
